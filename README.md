## 📦 Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

⚠️ If you previously added this integration as a custom repository in HACS, it's recommended to remove the custom entry and reinstall it from the official HACS store.
You will continue to receive updates in both cases, but switching ensures you're aligned with the official listing and avoids potential issues in the future.

Use this link to open the repository in HACS and click on Download

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ArikShemesh&repository=ha-simple-timer)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Card Not Appearing in Card Picker

1. **Restart Home Assistant:** The card is installed during integration setup
2. **Check integration logs:** Look for any errors during the card installation process
3. **Verify automatic installation:** Check if `/config/www/simple-timer/timer-card.js` exists
4. **Clear browser cache:** Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
5. **Check browser console:** Press F12 and look for JavaScript errors

### Timer Not Working

1. **Check device entity:** Ensure the controlled device exists and is accessible
2. **Verify integration setup:** Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Simple Timer
3. **Check logs:** Look for errors in Settings → System → Logs
4. **Restart integration:** Remove and re-add the integration if needed

### Daily Usage Not Tracking

1. **Device state changes:** Timer only tracks when the device is actually ON
2. **Manual control:** If you turn the device off manually, tracking stops (by design)
3. **Midnight reset:** Usage resets at 00:00 each day automatically

### Card Installation Issues

If the automatic card installation fails:
1. **Check file permissions:** Ensure Home Assistant can write to the `www` directory
2. **Verify disk space:** Ensure sufficient space for file copying
3. **Check integration logs:** Look for specific error messages
4. **Manual fallback:** You can still manually copy the card file from the integration's `dist` folder
